/*

1) Creating an Empty Directory 

2) Initialize it as a local git repository ( Note : Repository initialzed only once either by cli or by GitHub.com GUI )

3) Add Files in this directory

4) Then pushing content into online repository using its url 


*/



------------------------ Exercise

F:\WorkSpace\GIT>mkdir "GenericContent"

F:\WorkSpace\GIT>cd GenericContent

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in F:/WorkSpace/GIT/GenericContent/.git/

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        ReadMeFirst.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>git add -A

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>git commit -m "Add ReadMe.txt File"
[master (root-commit) c2c7c33] Add ReadMe.txt File
 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 ReadMeFirst.txt
 
To set branch as main( default )

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>git branch -M main

To link/connect local repository with online repository 

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>git remote add origin https://github.com/Yajuvendra1976/GenericContent.git

To push content of main branch into main branch of origin

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>git push -u origin main

 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\GenericContent>

Note : Prior to push , we have to create Git reposiotry online on GitHub.com ( Private/Public - For Ex : GenericContent named created in above example )
       But not to initialize there as we have to initialize from CLI side.
	   


Note : When we creata a repository on github then default branch name is main.
       But make sure only one need to exist either main/master .
