########################  Git Commands With sample exercise 


A) First create a online repository .For Ex -  With name knockoutjs and initilize it . ( Add a ReadMe file as well )

Note :  A repository can contain branches ( main/master and other branches )

        Repository can be public or private . And owner of repository provides access rights to other peoples.

B) Then on local machine Execute following command in sequence : 

1) git version - To check the version of used git

F:\>git version
git version 2.34.1.windows.1

2) git clone <GitHubRepository URL> : To create a clone( Local Repository ) of specified git repository at local machine ( cloning done of all branches including main )

        Note : Normally we don't create clone of main/master branch.
		
F:\WorkSpace\GIT>git clone https://github.com/ashishjain1547/knockoutjs.git

3) To list out all branches

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/dev
  origin/main
  
4) To see current branch : 

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git branch
* dev
  main


5) Switching in between branches :

To switch into main branch : 

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

To switch back into dev branch :

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git checkout dev
Switched to branch 'dev'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev'.


6)git pull : Is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
              
			Note : git pull is mandatory step , it updated all braches content
			       When we open explorer its show the content of currently switched branch 
				  
			Note : If we have to change content of any other branch , we need to switch branch first , before opening content in explorer .
				   Because in window its don't show any branch information . 

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git pull

 2 files changed, 26 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

	
7) git status : To check the current status of repositoty for any changes
                It suggest what next step to do ..

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git status
On branch dev
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        25_ValueAndTextBinding.html

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


8) git add -A : To add all changed file into stagging state ( To start tracking of changes ..)

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git add -A
F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git status
On branch dev
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   25_ValueAndTextBinding.html

9) git commit -m "Commit Message" : To commit changes locally in git repository

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git commit -m "Program Clean UP"
[dev bdcbecd] Program Clean UP
 1 file changed, 28 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 25_ValueAndTextBinding.html

10) git push  : To push changes into a online repository ( like dev branch ) for merging with main branch ( Merge Request )

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git push
remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/ashishjain1547/knockoutjs.git/'

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git push
info: please complete authentication in your browser...

   8532f9d..bdcbecd  dev -> dev

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>

Note : Now Merge request sent to owner of the repository to verify changes and merging content in main branch.

11) Getting help about GIT Commands

F:\WorkSpace\GIT\knockoutjs>git --help
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
See 'git help git' for an overview of the system.
